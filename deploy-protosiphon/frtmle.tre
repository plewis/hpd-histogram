>      Molecular clock not enforced
>      Starting branch lengths obtained using Rogers-Swofford approximation method
>      Trees with approximate log likelihoods 5% or further from the target score are rejected without additional iteration

>  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 1100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
>  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if branch length is less than or equal to 1e-08
>  'MulTrees' option in effect
>  No topological constraints in effect
>  Trees are unrooted
